# **Transfermarkt data scraper**

**Goal:** Scrape avg. market values, transfer expenses, previous season stats and attendance data from the most prominent clubs from Germany (Bundesliga), France (Ligue 1), Spain (La Liga), Italy (Serie A). All data was scraped from Transfermarkt, German-based website owned that has footballing information, such as scores, results, statistics, transfer news, and fixtures.

**Why?**
  * Context: a fellow Economics friend had started to manually scrape all this data to analyze for her Sports Economics class.
  * I really wanted her to get back to a healthy sleep schedule, so I decided to dedicate a bit of my time to this script so she could get her data (and her 8h of sleep a night)!

**What I've used**
*   Beautiful Soup: to scrape data out of Transfermarkt
*   Pandas: to create/manipulate a dataframe w/ football information
*   Xlsxwriter: to write results on an excel document
